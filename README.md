# Binary-Converter-Gui

Binary converter using the Dear ImGui header

Reccomended exe file is in Binary_Converter_Gui/Release/Binary_Converter_Gui.exe

ImGui header https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

The converter converts on frame, so the most inefficient thing about the converter is when there are a lot of characters,
the FPS drops heavily, I am trying to make it more efficient currently. I'm still learning C++ so this is probably garbage
compared to what it could be. As of 10/26/20 you can save to a file, I am trying to figure out how to copy to clipboard from the output window.

If you have any critiques let me know :)

# Binary-Converter-Gui

Binary converter using the Dear ImGui header

Reccomended exe file is in Binary_Converter_Gui/Release/Binary_Converter_Gui.exe

ImGui header https://github.com/ocornut/imgui


This Program is built on top of the DirectX-9 ImGui example... I personally like the ImGui header, it is easy to use and figure out and im glad I found it. I recommend ImGui, because of how easy it is to use and how easy it is to do things with great performance.


The converter converts on frame, so the most inefficient thing about the converter is when there are a lot of characters,
the FPS drops heavily, I am trying to make it more efficient currently. I'm still learning C++ so this is probably garbage
compared to what it could be. As of 10/26/20 you can save to a file, I am trying to figure out how to copy to clipboard from the output window.


If you have any critiques let me know :)
